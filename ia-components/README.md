Everything in ia-components was extracted from the iaux/ia-components repo.

Currently it has the same directory structure here. 

The components should work in both dweb and non-dweb scenarios. 

It was extracted from because the merge process in iaux takes too long to be viable 
- I gave up after a merge took 28 days, with turnaround in comments being 5-21 days!

All import and export is via the dweb-index.js to facilitate these being moved into
some collaborative development area if that happens in the future.
